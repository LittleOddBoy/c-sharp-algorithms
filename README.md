# C# Algorithms
now, we're in the 21 March 2024, and I'm currently studying some kind of CS in school. so one of our projects for the end of the semester is about C#. consider that we're in the first year of hight school, so isn't it a bad idea to not go in the depth about C# and these programming languages? pehaps no, because most of us are trying to understand the basics of the CS world and it's a little bit hard. hopefuly I've got these holiday in my country and after a long while, I found the time to do these boring C# projects. 
as you may guess, our projects in the book is very lower then what I wrote, because the focus isn't on learning algorithms. but I don't care. 

these are some algorithms that I found useful to transform to code, especially with C#. I found that the C# and its IDE (Visual Studio I mean) are God's gifts (even when I'm not believe in God) and I enjoyed a lot. 
surly I'll update this repo with more organized and better handwrite. I'm in the starter point man!

by the way, thank you, if you read the whole README. it was Amirhossein. stay alive.
